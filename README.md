# RRT* Search Algorithm

During my junior year at Northwestern, I became very interested in motion planning and controls. Iâ€™d heard of path finding algorithms and seen some examples of them in use and wanted to learn more. 

I decided to write a program that would implement the RRT* search algorithm and actively give me a visualization of the method. When running the program, you will be able to generate obstacles and set a start and endpoint for the algorithm.

## Getting Started

Successfully running the program should be extremely simple:

1. Clone the repository. You can find information on how to clone a repository from Github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Run RRTstar.py

### Prerequisites

I'm writing in Python using Visual Studio Code which is included with Anaconda. I would recommend that you use both of these and you can find information on how to install and set up Anaconda on your laptop [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

I'm also using the following Python libraries:
1. pygame
2. pylineclip
3. random

You will have to install these if you would like to run this code. You can easily install these using pip which also is included with Anaconda. To install these Python packages using pip, follow these steps:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt
2. Enter the command 'pip install <library_name>'. User the library names from above to install the necessary packages.
